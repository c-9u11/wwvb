# MAS6180C WWVB Clock

This is a modification of capt.tagon's wwvb clock receiver, which has been modified to work with an **[SSD1306 128x32 OLED](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf)**.
and the Universal Solder WWVB clock receiver. The receiver uses the **[MAS6180C IC](https://www.mas-oy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DA6180C.pdf)**.
This code is built for the old (discontinued) version of the receiver kit. It is **untested** with the latest version available from [Canaduino on
Universal Solder](https://www.universal-solder.ca/product/canaduino-60khz-atomic-clock-receiver-module-wwvb-msf-jjy60/#tab-description).
